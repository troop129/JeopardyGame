 A simple game based on the NBC TV Show "Jeopardy". Players answer prompts with a question and etiher win or lose money. The questions are arranged on board, sorted by categories, in acending value.

This is a dynamic implementation of the game, where the number of players can be adjusted and it will still work. The game was built upon the excellent starting point of a [Jeopardy game](https://github.com/scliff108/Jeopardy) by [scliff108](https://github.com/scliff108/). Thank you. The code is heavily modified but still runs on the basic framework he created.

The dropdown menu on the `index.html` page is from this [codepen](https://codepen.io/ig_design/pen/MWKVrNR). Thanks to [Ivan Grozdic](https://codepen.io/ig_design) for his excellent implementation.

You can see this project in action on a hosted [repl](https://jeopardygame.troop129.repl.co/).
